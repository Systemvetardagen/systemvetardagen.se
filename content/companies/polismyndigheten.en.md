  Are you ready for a bigger task?


  You don't have to be a police officer to work in the police force.


  The police's IT department has approximately 1,000 employees and is responsible for all IT used by the agency's approximately 36,000 employees. We are part of the law enforcment, we provide service to the citizens and make it easier for the authority's employees to carry out their tasks.


  As digitization increases, the police must be able to handle increasingly large amounts of data, take greater advantage of new technologies and constantly stay one step ahead of the criminals, without compromising security and legal certainty.


  To work in the police's IT department is to be a crucial part of the police's operations. Regardless of whether it is about developing new forensic technology, communicating via the police radio, simplifying citizens' contact with the authority, collecting digital evidence or paying salaries, well-functioning IT solutions are required.
