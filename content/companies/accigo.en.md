  A taste of what we offer:


  Freedom without bosses

  We have replaced managers and hierarchies with a network organization, where you manage your work together with your team.


  Exciting technical challenges

  In addition to our core values, Accigo is held together by a common and genuine interest in technology. We are constantly developing by working on assignments with the latest technology in various industries and by continuously spreading competence between our hubs.


  Strong community

  Joy and humor have topped the list for how we describe ourselves in our internal employee surveys four years in a row.


  Coaching, competence development and offer development

  Together with you, we take your development very seriously. Based on what you are passionate about and want to work with, you set your development ambition. Through our coaching program, offer development and role-specific skills development, you will then receive support in how to reach it.


  Sustainability plan
