  "Electronic Arts are all-in on Battlefield. We are committed to unlocking its

  connected Battlefield universe.


  DICE is a multiplayer powerhouse and will use its expertise to continue developing Battlefield’s one-of-a-kind multiplayer suite while our new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games, will be leading the development of a narrative campaign. Ripple Effect is focused on creating an entirely new Battlefield experience that will complement and build upon the series’ foundations. This is alongside Industrial Toys, leading development on Battlefield Mobile.


  Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, combining creativity, innovation, and passion. We fully champion inclusive culture and provide opportunities for growing, learning, and leading that allow for the most impactful and rewarding work of our teams’ careers. "
qualifications: Experience with C++, interest in games and developing games from
  a technical perspective, and ability to problem solve with guidance from
  engineers on the team.
