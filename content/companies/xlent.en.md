about_us: "This might be the first time you hear about XLENT - and that’s OK!
  Stating that we are an IT-consulting firm with almost 500 consultants divided
  over 15 cities in Sweden, doesn’t tell you WHY we enjoy working as consultants
  or WHY we have chosen XLENT. The best way to tell our story is for you to come
  visit us at our booth! You´ll meet us – who have taken the day off from
  developing, testing and project management – who are happy to discuss why
  consulting with XLENT is a good fit for us, and answer your questions. See you
  there! "
qualifications: As we work with both technology and people, interest/commitment
  to digitization, consulting and team delivery is merited rather than specific
  technical knowledge.
