  Did we know what we were getting into when in April 2022, we accepted our positions as project manager and coordinator? Absolutely not. Are we grateful for all the challenges and lessons we have learned along the way? Absolutely. Is this the most rewarding project we have worked on? Undoubtedly.\

  \

  This year's Systemvetardagen is characterized by one word: a fresh start. Since we took over the project management, we have started a long-awaited work to rebrand the fair, which we saw as a given after two years of a fair in a digital and hybrid format. Now we are finally back in action with a physical fair! The graphic profile has been changed, the exhibition floor looks different, and the website has been updated. We have questioned old structures and dared to think differently. At the same time, we have deepened meaningful collaborations to make the fair as lively as possible. This year we are laying a completely new foundation for future Systemvetardagar!\

  \

  We have also started the work to make the fair more environmentally conscious. The printed catalog has been replaced with a digital one. The large wall structures have been replaced with sound-absorbing mats. The lunch served to all those working on the fair and all those exhibiting during the day is vegan. Many small streams make a river and in a few years, the steps we take today will contribute to a better society.\

  \

  Driving a project of this caliber, with the scope and number of people involved, is an incredible challenge, and we are extremely proud of the work that everyone has done.\

  \

  We are incredibly happy to welcome over 50 companies to the NOD building on February 15th, and hope for many inspiring meetings.\

  \

  Warmly welcome to Systemvetardagen\
