  Did we know what we were getting into when in April 2022 we agreed to our
  positions as project managers and project coordinators? Absolutely not. Are we
  grateful for all the challenges and lessons we've learned along the way?
  Absolutely. Is this the most rewarding project we've worked on? Without a
  doubt.


  This year's Systemvetardagen is characterized by one word: a fresh start. Since we joined the project management, we have started a much-anticipated work to rebrand the fair, something that we saw as a given after two years of a fair in a digital and hybrid format. Now we are finally back in place with a physical fair! The graphic profile has been changed, the fair floor looks different, and the website has been updated. We have questioned old structures and dared to think new. At the same time, we have deepened rewarding collaborations to make the fair as lively as possible. This year, we are laying a completely new foundation for the future of Systemvetardagen!


  We have also started the work of making a more environmentally conscious fair. The printed catalog has been replaced with a digital one. The large booth walls have been replaced with sound-absorbing mats. The lunch served to all those working with the fair and all those exhibiting during the day is vegan. Many small streams become a river, and in a few years, the steps we take today will contribute to a better society.


  Driving a project of this caliber, with the extent and number of people involved, is an incredible challenge, and we are incredibly proud of the work that everyone has done.


  We are incredibly happy to welcome over 50 companies to the NOD building on February 15th, and we hope for many rewarding and inspiring meetings.


  Warmly welcome to Systemvetardagen
