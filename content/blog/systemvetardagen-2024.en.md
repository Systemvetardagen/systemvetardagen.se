  We are incredibly excited to announce that the Systemvetardagen is back! From the first day of this project, we have placed great emphasis on strong and sustainable group dynamics. It has truly been a game-changer for us.\

  \
 
  To ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible, each team has been assigned a deputy leader. This step has worked wonders for our workflow. A new system developed by our team, where companies can enter their information themselves, has greatly facilitated our process! And it doesn't stop there – we have also ramped up our marketing efforts to reach more people and have worked hand in hand with various sections of our student union DISK.\

  \
 
  Our focus has been on creating a fantastic event for both students and exhibitors. Systemvetardagen is not just a career fair – it's a chance for us to show what we can achieve together. We are a group of students with a wonderful mix of competencies, and we are ready to showcase them.\

  \
 
  So, mark the 21st of February in your calendars and come to NOD for an inspiring day. We look forward to welcoming all companies and hope for a day filled with fruitful conversations and new insights.\

  \
 
  And one last thing – leading a project of this size is not an easy challenge, but it was one we were willing to take on! It also requires a lot of coordination and commitment from many sides. A big thank you to all our team leaders, vice team leaders and team members, as well as to the sections that have been involved. Without your work and trust, this would not be possible. You are all heroes in this project!\

  **Warm welcome to Systemvetardagen 2024!**
