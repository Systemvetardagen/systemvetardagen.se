// SASS EXPLANATION
  /* Welcome to SASS. Sass is a pre-compiler that converts the .sass files 
    into one .css file which will ultimately be linked to the vue app. Please refer to the 
    partial files in the folders to add/modify styling. This main file merely imports partial
    files. New partial files can be created and linked to this main file. Please keep in mind
    that partial files must begin with an underscore character (e.g., _xyz.sass). When importing
    this is not required (see examples below). 
    
    To use Sass you must install the sass live complier (add-on in VS Code). If that
    doesn't work, please let me know. In the future, we might try to have vue compile
    the sass (but that hasn't been figured out yet).
